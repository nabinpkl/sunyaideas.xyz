          Sunya is an idea commit registry. You write an idea on your device, and a
          cryptographic fingerprint of that text is signed by your key and
          written to a public blockchain. Only the fingerprint is ever sent
          anywhere. The text itself stays with you.

      <Section title="The contract">
        <p>
          One contract, deployed to each supported chain. Same source, same
          bytecode. Every commit you see in this app was emitted by one of
          these addresses, and the source is published on Sourcify so anyone
          can reproduce the bytecode and read what the contract actually does.

          Note: Sepolia is a testnet, so its deployment is for testing purposes only.

      <Section title="The commit">
        <p>
          When you click commit, your browser handles the heavy lifting locally. It starts by 
          generating a <Mono>keccak256</Mono> hash of your text, creating a unique 
          fingerprint that would break if you changed even a single comma. Your wallet 
          then signs a message containing that hash, and finally, the signature is 
          pushed to the <Mono>CommitRegistry</Mono> contract. The contract 
          verifies the signature on-chain before recording a <Mono>Committed</Mono> event.
        </p>
        <p>
          The plaintext never leaves your device. Sunya operates no server, 
          no database, and no indexers. You bring your own wallet, sign your 
          own transactions, and handle your own gas.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="You don't have to trust us">
        <p>
          The claim that your plaintext never leaves your device is something
          you can check yourself in under a minute, without reading any
          source code. Open your browser&apos;s developer tools, switch to the
          Network tab, and start typing into the commit box. Every character,
          every file drop, and every keystroke is local. Watch the list. Nothing is sent
          anywhere. The hash is computed in JavaScript that already ran when
          the page loaded, so there is no network request to make.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you do click Commit, the only network activity you will see is
          your wallet talking to the chain&apos;s RPC endpoint to submit the
          signed transaction. That traffic carries the hash and the signature, 
          but it does not carry your plaintext, because the plaintext was never
          read by anything except the hash function.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to be stricter, use DevTools to block all requests to
          this domain after the page has loaded (Network tab, right
          click a request, Block request domain). The app keeps working:
          hashing still runs locally, the wallet still talks to the chain
          directly, and you have now cut Sunya out of the loop entirely for
          the rest of the session. There is nothing we could send or receive
          even if we wanted to.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="The reveal">
        <p>
          Later, if the idea is contested in a dispute or a priority argument, 
          you can reveal the original plaintext. Anyone can re-hash it themselves 
          to confirm that the hash matches the one recorded on chain at a specific 
          block, signed by your key. No trust in Sunya is required, and no trust 
          in any third party is required. The chain&apos;s block timestamp is the anchor.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Verify page on this app is one way to do that check, but it is
          not the only way. The contract is public and the event log is
          public; anyone can query it directly.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="If you lose the plaintext">
        <p>
          The commit remains on chain. Your signed hash is still there,
          still timestamped, and still verifiable as yours. But without the
          original bytes you can no longer reveal what was
          committed. A hash is a one-way function, so you cannot recover the
          text from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is deliberate. The reason the plaintext never touches Sunya
          is that no server can leak what it never had. The trade-off is
          that the responsibility for keeping the original content lives
          with you. If the bytes are gone, the evidence is reduced to
          &quot;this address committed some hash at this
          time,&quot; which is rarely enough on its own to matter in a
          dispute.
        </p>
        <p>
          Back up the plaintext somewhere you trust. Multiple places is
          better. The commit is the part we secure; the content is the part
          you secure.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="Your responsibility as an IP protector">
        <p>
          Sunya gives you one strong piece of evidence. You bring the rest.
          A credible case typically combines the commit with drafts, dated
          notes, related prior work, and corroborating
          communications. The commit anchors a specific claim to a specific
          point in time; the other evidence makes the claim legible and
          contextualizes it.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is one behavior that matters more than any technical
          detail: commit first, share later. If you discuss an idea with
          someone before committing it, then anyone with that 
          information can commit the same hash before you. Sunya secures 
          what you commit the moment you commit it. It cannot retroactively 
          protect anything you have already disclosed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wallet you use is your identity here. Protect its keys. If
          your key is compromised, someone else can commit under your
          identity, and your case weakens because observers can no longer
          distinguish your commits from the attacker&apos;s.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="What a commit is not">
        <p>
          A commit is not a patent, a legal filing, or a finding of originality. 
          It is not a guarantee that you had the idea first. It only proves you 
          committed this specific hash at this specific time, signed by this 
          specific key.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is one piece of evidence, cryptographically anchored, that no
          party can forge or backdate after the fact. How much that piece
          matters depends on what else you bring.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="What Sunya does not do">
        <p>
          There are no user accounts, no stored plaintexts, and no recovery
          flow. There is no &quot;admin&quot; who can edit the registry or
          reverse a commit. The contract has no owner and it is not
          upgradable. If it ever needs a material change, it will be
          redeployed as a new contract and existing commits will remain
          valid under the old one.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only things Sunya operates are the smart contracts and the
          static files of this client. Everything else, including key
          custody, gas, plaintext storage, and the decision of
          when to reveal, is yours.
