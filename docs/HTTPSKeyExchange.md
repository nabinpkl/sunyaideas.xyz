## The Two Uses of Public Key Crypto

Public key crypto does TWO different jobs: [en.wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography)

```
Job 1  ENCRYPTION (confidentiality):
  Anyone encrypts with your PUBLIC key
  Only you decrypt with your PRIVATE key
  
  Used by: Email (PGP/S/MIME), file encryption

Job 2  KEY EXCHANGE (establishing a shared secret):
  Two parties derive the SAME shared secret
  without sending the secret itself
  
  Used by: HTTPS, Signal, stealth addresses
```

***

## How Email Uses It (Job 1  Encryption)

```
Bob wants to email Alice secretly:

  1. Alice publishes her public key (PGP/S/MIME)
  2. Bob encrypts email WITH Alice's public key
  3. Sends ciphertext to Alice
  4. Alice decrypts with her private key ✅
  
  Eve intercepts the email → sees gibberish
  Only Alice can decrypt → only she has private key

Problem with normal email (Gmail etc):
  → No encryption by default
  → Gmail server reads everything
  → PGP exists but nobody uses it (UX nightmare)
```


***

## How HTTPS Uses It (Job 2  Key Exchange)

```
HTTPS doesn't encrypt EVERYTHING with public key.
That would be too slow for streaming data.

Instead  hybrid approach: [web:1503][web:1505]

  Step 1  Identity (public key):
    Server sends its certificate (contains public key)
    Browser verifies: "yes this is really amazon.com"
    
  Step 2  Key exchange (Diffie-Hellman):
    Browser + Server do ECDH to agree on a shared session key
    Nobody else can compute this session key ✅
    
  Step 3  Bulk encryption (symmetric):
    All actual data encrypted with that fast session key (AES)
    Public key crypto only used ONCE at the start

Public key = used for identity + key exchange
AES = used for actual data (1000× faster)
```

***

## How Signal Uses It (Both Jobs + More)

Signal is the most sophisticated: [cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/how-does-public-key-encryption-work/)

```
Signal uses:
  → Public key crypto for identity (who you are)
  → ECDH for key exchange (shared secret per session)
  → Double Ratchet algorithm (new key for EVERY message)
  → Forward secrecy (old messages can't be decrypted even if key stolen)

Each message has a fresh derived key.
Even if Signal's server is hacked → they can't read your messages.
Even if your phone is stolen → past messages are safe.
```

***

## How They All Connect To Stealth Addresses

```
All three use the SAME underlying math:

  Email (PGP):       encrypt(data, publicKey) → only privateKey decrypts
  HTTPS:             ECDH → shared session key → AES encrypt data  
  Signal:            ECDH + Double Ratchet → per-message keys
  Stealth addresses: ECDH → shared secret → derive one-time address

The shared secret in ECDH is the common thread:
  a × B = b × A = shared secret    ← Diffie-Hellman
  
  HTTPS uses it to encrypt traffic
  Signal uses it to derive message keys
  Stealth uses it to derive a one-time wallet address
```

 Same math, three different applications. Ethereum wallets, HTTPS, and Signal are all running the same elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman under the hood. [cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/how-does-public-key-encryption-work/)

Now  back to building? 😄

Perfect rabbit hole. Here's the full story cleanly. [en.wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman)

***

## The Problem HTTPS Solves

```
You visit amazon.com.
You need to send your credit card number.
Eve is watching the network cable between you and Amazon.

How do you agree on an encryption key with Amazon
without Eve learning that key?

You can't whisper it  Eve hears everything.
You can't email it  Eve reads email too.
```

***

## The Diffie-Hellman Insight (1976)

Two people can agree on a shared secret **over a public channel** that an eavesdropper is watching  and the eavesdropper learns nothing. [en.wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman)

```
Original version used modular arithmetic.
Modern version (ECDH) uses elliptic curve points.
Same idea, much smaller keys (256 bits vs 2048 bits).
```

***

## How HTTPS Actually Does It  Step By Step

```
1. You open amazon.com

2. Amazon sends its CERTIFICATE
   Contains: Amazon's public key + identity proof
   Signed by: a Certificate Authority (Verisign, Let's Encrypt etc)
   Your browser checks: "yes, I trust this CA, this is really Amazon"

3. KEY EXCHANGE (ECDH):

   Your browser:
     generates random private: a
     computes: A = a×G
     sends A to Amazon

   Amazon:
     generates random private: b
     computes: B = b×G
     sends B to your browser

   Eve sees: A and B floating on the wire. Useless alone.

   Your browser computes: a × B = a×b×G = shared secret
   Amazon      computes: b × A = b×a×G = shared secret
   
   Same secret. Neither sent it. Eve cannot compute it. ✅

4. Both sides feed shared secret into a KDF (key derivation function)
   → get a symmetric AES session key

5. All further traffic encrypted with that AES key
   Eve sees: gibberish ✅
```


***

## The Brilliant Part  Forward Secrecy

```
Old HTTPS (RSA):
  Browser encrypts the session key with Amazon's public key
  Sends it to Amazon
  Amazon decrypts with private key
  
  Problem: Eve records ALL traffic.
  10 years later Amazon's private key leaks.
  Eve decrypts ALL past conversations. ❌

Modern HTTPS (ECDHE  E = Ephemeral):
  a and b are generated FRESH for every single connection
  Thrown away immediately after
  Never stored anywhere
  
  10 years later Amazon's key leaks:
  Eve cannot decrypt past traffic because
  a and b no longer exist anywhere. ✅
  
  This is called Forward Secrecy.
```


***

## How Signal Extends This Further

```
HTTPS: one ECDH per connection (same key for whole session)

Signal  Double Ratchet:
  New ECDH key exchange for EVERY SINGLE MESSAGE
  Each message has its own derived key
  
  If your phone is stolen mid-conversation:
  Attacker gets current key
  Cannot decrypt past messages (already ratcheted forward) ✅
  Cannot decrypt future messages (new keys not yet derived) ✅
  
  Only the messages on screen at that moment are readable.
```

## The Full Family Tree

```
Diffie-Hellman (1976)
  └── Elliptic Curve DH / ECDH (1985)
        ├── HTTPS/TLS 1.3   → session key exchange
        ├── Signal           → per-message key exchange  
        ├── Noise Protocol   → used in WireGuard VPN
        ├── Age encryption   → modern file encryption
        └── Stealth Addresses → one-time wallet address derivation
```

Same 40-year-old math. Everything you use daily runs on it. [en.wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman)

Now  shall we build? 😄
